A Software Developer in love with Technology.

Beyond my professional life, I have a deep appreciation for continuous learning and self-development. I enjoy reading a wide range of books that expand my knowledge and inspire personal growth. Art and creativity also play a significant role in my life, allowing me to approach problem-solving with a unique perspective.

Staying active and healthy is important to me, which is why I engage in various sports and cherish outdoor activities such as hiking. These hobbies not only keep me physically fit but also provide a perfect balance to my IT-centric career, fueling my creativity and productivity.

## Biography

I was born in 1988 in Chișinău, Moldova, into a modest middle-class family.

<br>

### My Childhood
I had a fascinating childhood. I was passionate about football, freestyle wrestling, and visual arts. I grew up in the city, but I spent all my school holidays at my grandparents’ house in the countryside. I spent a lot of time in nature — climbing trees, eating fruits and vegetables straight from the garden, herding cows and horses, and simply enjoying a free and authentic rural life.  
I still remember those times with great nostalgia.

My father gave me my first computer while I was still in school, around the 5th–6th grade. It was an **IBM 386 running MS-DOS**. I used **Norton Commander** as a file manager, and even today I remember keyboard shortcuts like `Alt + F1` and `Alt + F2`, as well as floppy disks.

Later, my parents bought me a more powerful computer with **Windows 95**, and a few years after that, another one running **Windows 98**. I absolutely loved those operating systems. I still remember the clip arts and WordArt styles from Microsoft Word.

At school, we had computer science classes where the teacher explained what a computer is and its components. By that time, I already knew most of it because I had my own computer at home. That made learning easier, but also more enjoyable, as I was always curious to discover new things.

<br>

### That moment
One day at school, I was introduced to my first programming language: **Turbo Pascal**.  
We had to write a program by copying code from a notebook — handwritten code provided by the teacher. I didn’t even have the code in my notebook because I had missed the first lessons due to a cold, so I borrowed a classmate’s notes.

Honestly, at that moment I didn’t understand much about that strange text written on a blue background. After finishing the code, the teacher explained how to compile the program.  
To my surprise, I was the only student whose program compiled successfully on the first try. Most of my classmates had errors — missing commas or small syntax mistakes.

That moment became a strong motivation for me. I started enjoying writing small programs in Turbo Pascal and felt real satisfaction every time my code compiled successfully.

### Student years 
After finishing school, I graduated from the **College of Informatics**, where I studied for four years and obtained a diploma as a *Programming Technician*. During my studies, I also worked for two years as an engineer, taking care of a computer lab.

After classes, I continued experimenting with Turbo Pascal at home. Later, I discovered **Delphi**, which gave me an enormous boost of enthusiasm. I spent hours creating simple applications — calculators, text editors, and other small tools — which played an important role in shaping my experience.

After college, I continued my studies at the **Academy of Economic Studies of Moldova (ASEM)**, Faculty of Cybernetics and Economic Informatics, where I completed a three-year Bachelor’s degree.

Throughout my academic years, I built a strong foundation in IT. I studied programming languages such as **Pascal, C, C++, PHP**, database management, operating systems (**MS-DOS, Windows, Linux**), basic networking concepts, and more.

My studies played a crucial role in my career as a software developer. Toward the end of my academic journey, I developed a strong interest in **web development**. At that time, I worked with technologies such as **PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript** (before modern frameworks existed). I was able to build basic websites with user registration and login, lists, detail pages, and full CRUD functionality.

### My IT Career
After graduating from the academy, I worked as an **IT Engineer** in the IT Department of the **University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Chișinău**, where I gained valuable experience in both hardware and software. In parallel, I continued studying web development on my own in greater depth.

In 2015, I decided to focus seriously on **C# programming**. I already had a solid foundation from university, but it took me about two years of self-study — reading documentation, watching video tutorials, and building console applications — to gain confidence. Later, I attended a **C# course organized by Amdaris**, where I strengthened my knowledge of **OOP, SOLID principles**, and clean coding practices.

I truly fell in love with **C# and the .NET ecosystem** and decided to focus my career entirely in this direction.

In 2017, I joined **RodacInfo (Draytus / Datto)** as a **.NET Developer**, where I worked on multiple projects using technologies stack such as:
- ASP.NET WebForms
- Console applications
- Windows Forms applications
- JavaScript
- MySQL

It was challenging, but I gained a tremendous amount of experience.

Over the years, I worked as a **Full Stack .NET Developer** in several companies, including **Aspira Software (KeyIVR)**, **DAS Solutions**, **Cegeka** and **AROBS**.  

My technology stack remained relatively consistent and included:
- ASP.NET Core Web API / ASP.NET MVC  
- MS SQL Server / PostgreSQL  
- Entity Framework  
- Angular  

Currently, I work as a **Senior Full Stack .NET Developer**. In my free time, I dedicate a lot of effort to continuous learning, improving my skills, and working on small personal projects.

> I enjoy the IT profession, discipline, art, nature, animals, and traveling.
