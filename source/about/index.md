A Software Developer in love with Technology, with over 10+ years of experience.

Beyond my professional life, I have a deep appreciation for continuous learning and self-development. I enjoy reading a wide range of books that expand my knowledge and inspire personal growth. Art and creativity also play a significant role in my life, allowing me to approach problem-solving with a unique perspective.

Staying active and healthy is important to me, which is why I engage in various sports and cherish outdoor activities such as hiking. These hobbies not only keep me physically fit but also provide a perfect balance to my IT-centric career, fueling my creativity and productivity.

I am currently working as a .Net Full Stack developer.

âš™ Tech Stack:
 - ASP.NET Web API
 - Angular
 - MS SQL Server
 - Entity Framework Core
