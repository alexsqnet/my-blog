When you start learning **ASP.NET Core**, the `Program.cs` file can feel overwhelming.  
So many methods, so many configurations — authentication, middleware, services, pipelines…

Here’s the good news:

> - You do **NOT** need to memorize everything in `Program.cs`  
> - You only need to understand **how it works conceptually**

This article will help you build a **simple mental model** so you always know *what goes where* — even if you forget the exact syntax.

## The Big Picture

`Program.cs` does **two main things**:

1. **Registers services** (Dependency Injection)
2. **Configures the HTTP request pipeline** (middleware)

If you understand these two ideas, everything else becomes much easier.


## Registering Services (Dependency Injection)

This is the part where you tell ASP.NET Core:

> “My application needs these services to work.”

Examples:
- Controllers
- Entity Framework DbContext
- Authentication (JWT, cookies)
- Swagger
- CORS
- Custom application services

### Example

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options => ...);
builder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddJwtBearer(...);
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
```

### How to recognize a **service**

Ask yourself:

> “Will I inject this into a constructor?”

If the answer is **yes**, it probably belongs in `builder.Services`.


## Configuring the Middleware Pipeline

Middleware defines **how an HTTP request flows through your application**.

Think of it like a **pipeline**:

```
Request → Middleware → Middleware → Controller → Response
```

Each middleware can:
- Inspect the request
- Modify it
- Stop it
- Pass it forward

### Example

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

### Important rule!

**Order matters**.

For example:
- `UseAuthentication()` must come **before**
- `UseAuthorization()`



## The Most Common `Program.cs` Template (90% of APIs)

This is the structure you’ll see in most ASP.NET Core projects:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// 1. Services
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

var app = builder.Build();

// 2. Middleware
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

If you understand this template, you already understand most ASP.NET Core applications.


## Where Do Common Features Go?

| Feature | Services | Middleware |
|------|---------|------------|
| Controllers | `AddControllers()` | `MapControllers()` |
| Authentication | `AddAuthentication()` | `UseAuthentication()` |
| Authorization | — | `UseAuthorization()` |
| Swagger | `AddSwaggerGen()` | `UseSwagger()` |
| CORS | `AddCors()` | `UseCors()` |
| EF Core | `AddDbContext()` | — |
| Static files | — | `UseStaticFiles()` |



## What You SHOULD Memorize

- Services vs Middleware concept
- The idea of a request pipeline
- `AddControllers()` + `MapControllers()`
- Authentication before Authorization
- `Environment.IsDevelopment()`


## What You Should NOT Memorize

- JWT validation parameters
- Swagger configuration details
- EF Core advanced options
- CORS policy edge cases

These are **reference knowledge**, not memory knowledge.



## Final Advice

ASP.NET Core is **modular by design**.

You are not expected to remember everything —  
you are expected to **recognize patterns**.

Once the mental model is clear:
- Reading other people’s `Program.cs` files becomes easy
- Debugging configuration issues becomes logical
- Adding new features feels natural

> Learn the structure.  
> Look up the details.

That’s how real-world ASP.NET Core development works.



Happy coding 🚀
